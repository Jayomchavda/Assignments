Q. What are the default Bootstrap text settings?
Ans. In Bootstrap 5 the HTML <small> element (and the .small class) is used to create a smaller,
 secondary text in any heading
Use a native font stack that selects the best font-family for each OS and device.
For a more inclusive and accessible type scale, we use the browser’s default root font-size (typically 16px) so visitors can customize their browser defaults as needed.
Use the $font-family-base, $font-size-base, and $line-height-base attributes as our typographic base applied to the <body>.
Set the global link color via $link-color.
Use $body-bg to set a background-color on the <body> (#fff by default).

Q. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?

	It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive.
