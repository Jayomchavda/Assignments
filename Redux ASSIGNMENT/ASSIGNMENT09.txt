									React â€“ Applying Redux

 What is Redux?
ANS : Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments, and are easy to test. While it's mostly used as a state management tool with React, you can use Redux with any other JavaScript framework or library.

What is Redux Thunk used for?
ANS : Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.

What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?
ANS :It implements a shouldComponentUpdate method with a shallow prop and state comparison. Unlike a regular Component, which re-renders whenever a state or props changes, a PureComponent performs a shallow comparison to determine if the actual values have changed, not just the reference.

What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is
its purpose?
ANS: setState is a callback function which gets called immediately after the setState is completed and the components get re-rendered.
