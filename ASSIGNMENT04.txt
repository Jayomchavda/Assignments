	 Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

Q.What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
Ans. Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
	 there is 6 type of loop 
		(1) while loop 
		(2) do while loop 
		(3) for loop 	
		(4) for of loop  (array)
		(5) for in loop  (object)
		(6) foreach loop (array/object)

while loop : (syntax)
while(condition){
    statement;
    increment/ decrement
}

do..while loop : (syntax)
do{
    statement;
    increment/ decrement
}while(condition)

for loop :
initialization = declaration
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
    statement
}


Q.What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
Ans. The use of innerHTML very slow: The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly built, also already	 	 parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.

Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: The event handlers do not get attached to the new elements created by setting innerHTML automatically. 

To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it to new elements manually.
This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.
